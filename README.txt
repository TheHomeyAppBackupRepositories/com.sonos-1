Experience brilliant sound in your home.

Features include, among others:

— Control your Sonos speakers (play/pause/etc.)
— Add players to groups
— Play music from your Local Library
— Play your Sonos Favorites
— Switch to Line-In
— Play sounds from the Homey Soundboard app
— Say something using text-to-speech

To play content from 3rd party services such as TuneIn, Spotify, Apple Music etc., add the track or playlist to your Sonos Favorites. You can then start a Sonos Favorite from a Flow.

Note: Both Sonos S1 & S2 speakers are supported, but S1 has some limitations. For example, listeners can’t group players in an S1 system with players in an S2 system.
